# TfCD_A2_Generative_Jar
Generated Jar for TfCD [Generative Design][TfCD] - https://www.instructables.com/id/Generated-Jar-Generative-Design-TfCD/

In this example we define the basic shape of a jar, then the final shape will be generated randomly within the user constrains, the color will be given by the temperature sensor and the height and width will be set by user input. The user will be able to save the generated design as a .STL file, which can be used to 3D print or modify it.

This project uses OpenJSCAD and Johnny Five to generated and download the files (the first) and to manage the arduino board with node, the second.
